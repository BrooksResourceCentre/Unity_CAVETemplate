# Overview

This repository is a basic Unity template for a three wall and one floor CAVE system with appropriate scene projection.
Expanding on the work by [Apt AS](https://github.com/aptas) within [Off-axis projection in Unity](https://github.com/aptas/off-axis-projection-unity).

Within this project are configurations for the Brooks CAVE, a 5m by 5m floorspace, with walls 2.8125m.




------------------------------------------

## UNFINISHED DRAFT: How it works

The technique implemented from the pervious project is 'off-axis projection'. With this method a camera's near plane and camera point are disconnected, for this CAVE project, each rendered wall or the floor has a camera with corrisponding near render plane, that render plane has a fixed size and position to replicate the physical real-world CAVE space

## UNFINISHED DRAFT: How to use

1. Use the appropriate prefab for your desired setup (e.g. a selection of walla and the floor)

## UNFINISHED DRAFT: Development Roadmap

- Performance stress test. Is this implementaion suitable?
